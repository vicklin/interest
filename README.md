# shellStock
在linux控制台下看股票，再也不用担心被老板diao～ 😂

# terminal-stocks
This is a demo that you can view stocks in terminal.
We use Sina Stock API.

## How to use

First copy the repo into your disk.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vicklin/interest.git
```

then

```bash
$ cd interest/shellStock/

$ chmod +x start.sh

$ ./start.sh
```

of course you can make an alias in your .bashrc or make a link so that you can call this application anywhere you like.
## Add your stocks

Edit interest/shellStock/codes, just put stock codes here:
```bash
sh000001
sz399006
sh600536
sz002095
```

With idea, you can catch every point of the stock easily even if you are coding. That's awesome!
